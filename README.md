# CS441_Assignment1
	This assignment is designed to be a unit converter. There are three different menus to utilize:

# 1. Imperial Measurements
	Contains text boxes for inches, feet, yards, and miles.

# 2. Metric Measurements
	Contains text boxes for centimeters, meters, kilometers, and light-seconds.

# 3. Temperatures
	Contains text boxes for degrees fahrenheit, degrees celsius, kelvin, and cats (I'll explain later)

User can enter a decimal number in any of these boxes, and after pressing the "convert" button on the bottom left of the screen,
the other text boxes will be filled in with values equivalent to the entered number, accurate to their respective measurement.

There is one exception to this rule, and that is the "cats" text box.
When in degree mode (where the text boxes contain temperatures and the fourth box is for cats), and a user enters a value in any of the temperature boxes, the "cats" box will display a random value from 10 to 110.
If the user enters a value directly into the cat text box and presses the "convert" button, the app will enter "Cat Mode" for the remainder of the session. In cat mode, there will be pictures of cats between each of the text boxes.
The edit text boxes will temporarily contain the string "C A T S", except the very first one, which will contain "m a s h e d p o t a t o". This is because the first picture is not actually of a cat, but of an internet-famous dog named Mashed Potato, due to his visual similarity to the food.

To convert multiple values, the user must either press the "clear" button on the bottom right, or switch to a different mode, which will clear the boxes automatically.
